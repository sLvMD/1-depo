        <p>
            Dear Thierry, <br>

            "To the world you may be one person, <br>

            "But to one person you are the world. <br>

            "You are the wind beneath my wings. <br>

            "You've made me smile when I was down – specifically the time that you scored that worldie past Barthez
            whilst I
            was recovering in hospital after an operation on a twisted testicle. <br>

            "You have delighted me, <br>

            "You have excited me <br>

            "And in return if you ever want to have a go on my Mrs – you have my blessing". <br>

            We think Gemma Chan might have something to say about that... <br>

        <b>Arsenal</b> Football Club, commonly referred to as Arsenal,[4] is a professional football club based in
        Islington, London, England. Arsenal plays in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. The
        club has
        won 13 league titles (including one unbeaten title), a record 14 FA Cups, two League Cups, 16 FA Community
        Shields,
        one European Cup Winners' Cup, and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. In terms of trophies won, it is the
        third-most
        successful club in English football.
        <p>Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join the Football League in 1893, and they
            reached the
            First Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top
            division,[7]
            and have won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history.[8] In the 1930s, Arsenal
            won five
            League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>

        <b>1886–1919: from Dial Square to Arsenal</b>
        <p>In October 1886, Scotsman David Danskin and fifteen fellow munitions workers in Woolwich formed Dial
            Square
            Football Club, named after a workshop at the heart of the Royal Arsenal complex. Each member contributed
            sixpence and Danskin also added three shillings to help form the club.[5][a] Dial Square played their
            first
            match on 11 December 1886 against Eastern Wanderers and won 6–0.<sup>[20]</sup> The club renamed to Royal
            Arsenal a
            month
            later,[19][21] and its first home was Plumstead Common,[19] though they spent most of their time playing
            at the
            Manor Ground. Their first trophies were the Kent Senior Cup and London Charity Cup in 1889–90 and the
            London
            Senior Cup in 1890–91; these were the only county association trophies Arsenal won during their time in
            South
            East London.[22][23] In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first London club to turn professional.[24]

        </p>
        <h3>Colours</h3>
        <p>For much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and
            white
            shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable
            donation
            from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members,
            Fred
            Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put
            together
            the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and
            received a set
            of kit and a ball.[106] The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts
            and socks
            with blue and white hoops.[107][108]
